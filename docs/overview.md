# Empire Overview

This repository is a curated skeleton for the Austin Empire project. It documents the high-level concepts and contains assets, a codex, and starter content for digital, physical, and financial components of the project.

## Structure
- assets/: branding and UI styles
- docs/: public documentation and the sanitized Codex
- src/: conceptual modules to be filled in with content
- scripts/: tooling to maintain the codex and build logs

> Fill the relevant `src/` folders with your content and update `docs/public-codex.json` with exported entries.
