# Austin Codex – Empire Overview

> **“A living blueprint that turns systems into fortunes – the next decade is built on architecture, not hype.”**

## What you’ll find here

* A modular API service that turns Markdown‑style templates into PDF business plans, contracts, CVs, etc.
* A CI pipeline that builds a Docker image and can send it to Render, Fly.io, or any container host.
* A tiny logger + JWT auth layer that protects the endpoint.
* A build‑log that records every architectural decision (immutable, append‑only).

Happy hacking! 🚀
